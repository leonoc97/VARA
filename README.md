# VARA
Vision Assisted Robotic Arm 

Description:

This project aims to develop and maintain a test bench for a robotic arm system capable of identifying and interacting with objects within a defined workspace. Utilizing a combination of computer vision techniques and mechanical automation, the project seeks to enhance the capabilities of robotic arms for precise object manipulation and recognition.

Objective:

Develop a Robotic Test Bench: Create a fully functional setup where a robotic arm can reliably identify various objects using camera systems and ArUco markers.
Integrate Computer Vision: Implement and refine computer vision algorithms to detect and classify objects. This includes enhancing the accuracy and speed of object recognition under different environmental conditions.
Automate Object Manipulation: Enable the robotic arm to perform precise movements based on the identified objects’ positions and characteristics, such as size, shape, and orientation.
Test and Optimize: Continuously test the system's performance and make iterative improvements to ensure reliability, efficiency, and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
Technologies Used:

Arduino for controlling the robotic arm mechanics.
Python for processing and command execution, including libraries such as OpenCV for image processing.
GitHub for version control and collaboration, facilitating updates and tracking of the project’s progress.
Collaboration:

Contributors are welcome to join the project to bring in fresh ideas, provide solutions to existing challenges, and help in the testing and development of new features.
